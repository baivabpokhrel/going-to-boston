# Brief Description of the game
This is a "bar betting game" arranged from a traditional "Going to Boston" version. You will play with a computer. At the beginning, you and computer have the initial allowance of $1,000 each, and the game will continue until one becomes broke...

On one turn, you and computer roll three dice and show the two numbers of them but one die number being hidden. Based on the odds you think of, you will bet $1 to $10. The outcome is called "Big Fish!" if the three numbers are identical such as 1-1-1 and 2-2-2. At this point, each player should be holding only three dice; you do not be rolling any more die. Only after you determine that neither player has a Big Fish and only after you determine the highest of the three die that a player holds  you roll additional dice.  It only rolls a die when needed, not before it is needed.

If not Big Fish, set aside the highest die and re-roll the other two. Keep the highest die of the two and re-roll the last. The total of all three dice is scored, and the bet amount multiplied by the difference of yours and computer's will be added/subtracted to each allowance. If Big Fish, the bet amount will be multiplied by 50 and added/subtracted.

If both the human and computer have the same sum, it ouputs the message "Tied" and print out unchanged money holdings (allowance) on hand for you and the computer. And then, for you and the computer, both should have a new set of three die values.

The same thing happens if both the human and computer both get a "Big Fish". Regardless of their sums, it is a tie. You should print out "Tied" and for both print out the Big Fish message.
